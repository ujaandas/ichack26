# Hackathon Starterkit

This project is structured as a clean, minimal full‑stack setup using:

- **FastAPI** for the backend
- **React + Vite + TanStack Router** for the frontend
- **PostgreSQL** for the database
- **HeyAPI** for typed API clients
- **Docker Compose** for local infrastructure (Postgres, pgweb, backend)

The goal is to keep things simple, explicit, and easy to extend.
