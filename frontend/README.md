# Hackathon Starterkit Frontend

The frontend is a dead-simple React.js app that uses Cesium and Resium. It aims to be as minimal as possible, as all
the project really demands is an SPA.

# Getting Started

First, you need to fill out the `.env` file.

1. Make a copy of `.env.example`
2. `VITE_CESIUM_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be acquired by signing up for a Cesium ION account at [ion.cesium.com](https://ion.cesium.com/). Open ION and go to `Access Tokens` on the top, and copy-paste it into the `.env`.
3. `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is literally just the backend's URL.
